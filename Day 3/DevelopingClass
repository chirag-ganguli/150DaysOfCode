Developing a Class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure out what the class is supposed to do
List instance variables & methods
Write prepcode (pseudocode) for the methods
Write test code for the methods
Implement the class
Test the methods
Debug and Reimplement as needed

The concept of writing the test code first is one of the prctices of Extreme Programming (XP)
