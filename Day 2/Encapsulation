Hiding the data from future value change and issues

Suppose we have, theCat.height = 27;

Now if suppose the value is changed to theCat.height = 0 which we don't want

public void setheight (int ht)
{
    if (ht > 9)
    {
        height = ht;        // We put in checks to guarantee a minimum cat height
    }
}

Hiding the data ?   <--  private and public access modifier
